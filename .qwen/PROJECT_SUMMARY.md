# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Create a Spotify music downloader backend that extracts Spotify track metadata, finds equivalent audio on alternative platforms, and downloads audio files using yt-dlp or alternative methods, while providing a frontend interface for users.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js backend with Express, Python with yt-dlp, HTML/JavaScript frontend
- **Architecture**: MVC pattern with models, controllers, and routes
- **File Locations**: 
  - Main server: `server-mvc.js`, `app.js`
  - Models: `models/SpotifyModel.js`
  - Controllers: `controllers/SpotifyController.js`
  - Routes: `routes/spotifyRoutes.js`
  - Python scripts: `yt-dlp/downloader.py`
  - Frontend: `public/index.html`
- **Downloads**: Files saved to `downloads/` folder
- **API Endpoint**: POST `/download-spotify` for processing Spotify URLs
- **Key Challenge**: YouTube anti-automation restrictions preventing direct yt-dlp downloads

## Recent Actions
- [DONE] Set up complete Node.js/Express backend with MVC architecture
- [DONE] Implemented Python script for metadata extraction and audio download using yt-dlp
- [DONE] Created HTML frontend interface with download functionality
- [DONE] Fixed JSON parsing issues in Node.js-Python communication
- [DONE] Handled YouTube's anti-automation restrictions by switching to Piped API
- [DONE] Implemented Piped API integration at `https://api.piped.private.coffee/streams/`
- [DONE] Successfully tested complete flow: metadata extraction → platform search → audio download
- [DONE] Removed failing yt-dlp download option and retained only Piped API approach
- [DONE] Verified multiple file downloads working correctly in downloads folder

## Current Plan
- [DONE] Implement complete backend functionality
- [DONE] Handle YouTube restrictions with Piped API
- [DONE] Create functional frontend interface
- [DONE] Test complete flow end-to-end
- [TODO] Consider implementing additional Piped API backup instances for reliability
- [TODO] Add more comprehensive error handling and user feedback in frontend
- [TODO] Potentially add rate limiting and concurrent download management
