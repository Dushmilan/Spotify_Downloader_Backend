Note: This is a simplified placeholder implementation.
To get real Spotify metadata, you would need to:

1. Register an app at https://developer.spotify.com/
2. Implement OAuth authentication
3. Use the Spotify Web API to get track information

For example:
GET https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/{id}
Authorization: Bearer {access_token}

A full implementation would make authenticated requests to:
https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/{track_id}
